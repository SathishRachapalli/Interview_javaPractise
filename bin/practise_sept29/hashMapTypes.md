Idenity Hashmap  -- uses '==' operator instead of equals() 
and also it considers the hashcode from System.hashCode() instead of regular hashcode().

Weak HashMap  --  will removes the entries which are no longer in use
--used in caching process


Both allows one single null key and many null values
